# Week-3-Mini-Project
MY NOTES:

*Very helpful video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2_z34QFVjw

*StackOverflow helped with Play Again feature. Told me to put the whole game in a function so that I could put it in a while loop.

*Need to figure out how to get the stats alert to keep adding points to the score board with each round.

*Need to figure out how to make the while loop not ask if a user wants to play again after hitting cancel.


PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS:

*As a user I want to play Rock Paper Scissors against an automated opponent.

*As a user I can enter R P or S to signify my choice of rock paper or scissors.

*As a user I expect the computer to choose R P or S in return.

*As a user I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

*As a user I want to see my total wins ties and losses after each round.

Specifications

*Must use the alert() confirm() and prompt() methods to collect user input and display information to the user.

*The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.
